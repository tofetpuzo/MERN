# MERN STACK

This is my third project , 
MERN stands for MongoDB Database, Express.js, React.js and Node.js

These components are used to create 
dynamic website for users and  provide developer with a framework for achieving this goal. 
The components can be classified into 3 tiers; the frontend, the middle and the database tiers. 

React.js: This is top tier of the web framework, which allows javascript framework to be used to create dynamic client side applications in HTML. React is best known for handling data-driven interfaces with minimal code.

Express.js and Node.js are considered the middle the server-side framework. The Express.js is embedded inside the Node.js server-side and is capable of using powerful tools embedded in it for URL routing and handling HTTP requests and responses.

MongoDB is the final tier; this allows applications to store information
