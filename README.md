# MERN STACK

This is my third project , 
MERN stands for MongoDB Database, Express.js, React.js and Node.js

These components are used to create 
dynamic website for users and  provide developer with a framework for achieving this goal. 
The components can be classified into 3 tiers; the frontend, the middle and the database tiers. 

React.js: This is top tier of the web framework, which allows javascript framework to be used to create dynamic client side applications in HTML. React is best known for handling data-driven interfaces with minimal code.

Express.js and Node.js are considered the middle the server-side framework. The Express.js is embedded inside the Node.js server-side and is capable of using powerful tools embedded in it for URL routing and handling HTTP requests and responses.

MongoDB is a database and the final tier for web framework ; this allows applications to store information such as user profiles, contents, comments, uploads and events. The MongoDB stores information in JSON format which comes from REACT.js frontend side sent through the Express.js server, where they are processed and sent directly to MongDB for retrieval later.
